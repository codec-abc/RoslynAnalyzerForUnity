# USP0014 The Unity runtime invokes Unity messages

Unity messages should not be flagged as candidates for static modifier.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

CA1822 - Mark members as static

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	void Update()
	{
		//Some code that does not access instance data
	}
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

Members that do not access instance data or call instance methods can be marked as static for performance reasons.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Unity messages will not be processed if they are marked static.
